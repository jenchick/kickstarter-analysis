## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to examine Kickstarter data to uncover trends and determine the best course of action for Louise to take in launching her first Kickstarter campaign to fund her play, "Fever."  Louise has a goal to raise over $10,000 for her production. 

## Analysis and Challenges
How you performed your analysis using images and links to code
The analysis was performed by extracting historical crowd-funding data which then organized, sorted, and analyzed.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
The Outcomes Based on Launch Date data indicated that May, by far, was the most successful month to launch a campaign.  The months following May, up until July, are also successful, but show a steady decline with December being the least successful month of all.  In addition, May and June appeared to be the most popular months for launching campaigns.  Of the 1,369 campaigns analyzed, 61% were successful, 36% failed, and 3% were cancelled. 

The Outcomes Based on Goals data indicated that campagins with a goal of less than $1,000 appeared to be most successful. Campaigns ranging in $1,000 to $4,500 were the next most successful; and also had the highest total number of projects and highest number of failed campaigns.  Campaigns in the range of Louise's goal of $10,000 to $14,999 were 54% successful. 

There are limitations to this analysis based on the current data set.  I think it would be useful to have geographical data to compare with Louise's location. For example, if the majority of successful campaigns are in Texas, New York, and California, but Louise is in Kentucky where most campaigns fail, that would be extremely useful to know. It would also be helpful to have the plays identified by genre to determine if genre influences campaign success.

Other possible tables and/or graphs we could create
It would be useful to examine the dataset further by Country and exclude locations not pertinent to Louise.  It would also be useful to 
The Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date data utilizes the entire category of "Theater" which in addition to the Subcategory of Plays includes Musicals and Theater Spaces. The Outcomes Based on Goals data only uses a subcategory "Plays".
