## Results
The Outcomes Based on Launch Date data indicated that May, by far, was the most successful month to launch a campaign.  The months following May, up until July, are also successful, but show a steady decline with December being the least successful month of all.  In addition, May and June appeared to be the most popular months for launching campaigns.  Of the 1,369 campaigns analyzed, 61% were successful, 36% failed, and 3% were cancelled. 

The Outcomes Based on Goals data indicated that campagins with a goal of less than $1,000 appeared to be most successful. Campaigns ranging in $1,000 to $4,500 were the next most successful, and also had the highest total number of projects and highest number of failed campaigns.  Campaigns in the range of Louise's goal of $10,000 to $14,999 were 54% successful.
